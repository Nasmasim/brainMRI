# Age Regression from Brain MRI
The objective of this project is to implement two supervised learning approaches for age regression from brain MRI. Predicting the age of a patient from their brain MRI scan can have diagnostic value for a number of diseases that may cause structural changes and potential damage to the brain. A discrepancy between the predicted age and the real, chronological age of a patient might indicate the presence of disease. This requires an accurate predictor of brain age which may be learned from a set of healthy reference subjects, given their brain MRI data and their actual age.
